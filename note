1. Declear variable called 'country','contient' and 'population and assign their values according to your own country (population in million)
log their values to the console.

Rules of declaring varible
1. Never start naming a variable with upper case e.g const Surname`

Primitive Data Type:-
1. Strings - Words and texts and they are always put inside quotations marks. E.g 'Wisdom', 'Orange', 'Brown', etc.
2. Numbers - Numbers are whole numbers that range from 1 to infinity. E.g 34,45,100,75, 1035 etc.
Booleans - Booleans are used to return truthy or falsy values. They are true/ False.
Undefined - Undefined values are variables that have no value in them. E.g Let Wardrobe;
Null - Null values explain nothingness E.g (0)

Operators in JavaScrip;

four main categoreies of JavaScrapt Operators

1. Assignment Operatiom- used to assign a value to a varible E.g equall to (=)
2. Mathematical Operators- Are used to perform arithmetical operators E.g (+ - / * % **)
3.  (Comparsion Operators) - Are used to compare two or more values together. comparison operators always return a Booleans value. E.g (> >= <= == === != !==)
4. Logical operators - Are used to perform logic, logical operators alwats return a Booleans values e.g &&,||, !.
The AND (&&) Logical operator is used when ALL the conditions are true
The (||) logical operators is used when AT LEASE ONE condition is true
The NOT (!) logical operator is used to negate a condition.



Class Work

2. Log the type of 'isIsland', 'population','country', and 'language' to the console.


/// NEW ASSIGNMENT

Assignment: 

1. Create a variable of student and store the value of your name in it;

2. Create variables of school, course, favorite food, occupation, gender, age, isAnHonestPerson and use your own information as values for each of these variables. 

3. Using string concatenation, create a variable called studentDescription that logs to the console the string using your own variables but using this format “Wisdom is a Web Developer and is a 30-year old male. It is true that Wisdom is honest and is a huge rice fan 😊”

4. Create another variable called studentDescription2 that logs to the console the string above in question 3 but this time using template literals. 

Good luck 😊
